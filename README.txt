Hi!, just a quick note, I did the project using Sass CSS-preprocessor because I didn't know how to use it
and the name of the project kinda reminded me of it, you know SaaS and Sass lol, so this was my first time ever using a preprocessor so advice will be appreciate it, I did divide my Sass files into multiple files
so that it would be easier to find an error if one ever occurred, but I never looked at the CSS file created by Sass all the way until the end, but I havent toched it, all my css was written in the Sass Files

this project was definitly a challenge I just hope everything will be fine when you see it, I did my tests, but well you never know
